# Spin-Orbit Coupling Effect in Semiconductors
> Numerical calculation of spin transport involving Rashba/Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling

## Background 
The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) occurs in many areas of physics. Discovered in the fine structure of atomic spectra, 
later introduced to explain the nuclear structure, it is now also of great interest in condensed matter systems, 
such as graphene and semiconducting materials with promising spintronics applications. It is also found 
in the physics of optical lattices mimicking condensed matter systems. The SOC is characterized by interaction 
terms that contain position r, momentum p and spin operators S.  

In spintronics, the spin–orbit coupling is manifest as Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions. The Rashba interaction 
is the signature of structure inversion asymmetry (SIA) present in essentially two-dimensional materials. 


## Simulation
The mathematica files are based on the analytical wave function based on the propagator method whereas the matlab files are 
numerical evolution of wave function where no analytical solution is available. Again, the numerical evolution relies on the
use of Trotter's formula within short time approximations.

It should be noted in matlab, I have also calculated the case where a simple harmonic oscillator potential is present on top of the spin-orbit interactions.
